# Retina-CSVD

The file "UKB_retinal_CSVD_markers.xlsx" contains retinal imaging analysis markers based on the UKB dataset, along with values for white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) and choroid plexus volume (CPV). It serves as the database used in the study "Retinal Vascular Morphology Reflects and Predicts Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: Evidence from Eye-Brain Imaging Analysis," where retinal imaging features are used to predict WMHV and CPV values.

## Definitions of the features
WMHV: Volume of white matter hyperintensities.
CPV: Choroid plexus volume, associated with cerebrospinal fluid production and neuroinflammation.
QC: Quality control metric (0=good, 1=usable, 2=bad).
Fractal Dimension: Quantifies vascular network complexity and geometric patterns.
Vessel Density: Proportion of vascular area per unit tissue area, indicating blood supply.
Average Width: Average diameter of vessels.
Distance Tortuosity: Path length-to-straight length ratio, indicating vascular curvature.
Squared Curvature Tortuosity: Sum of squared curvature values, quantifying vascular bending severity.
Tortuosity Density: Density of vascular tortuosity.
Artery Fractal Dimension: Complexity of the arterial network structure.
Artery Vessel Density: Proportion of arterial area per unit tissue area.
Artery Average Width: Average diameter of arteries, representing overall arterial size.
Artery Distance Tortuosity: Degree of arterial path curvature.
Artery Squared Curvature Tortuosity: Cumulative squared curvature values of arteries.
Artery Tortuosity Density: Density of arterial tortuosity.
Vein Fractal Dimension: Complexity of the venous network structure.
Vein Vessel Density: Proportion of venous area per unit tissue area.
Vein Average Width: Average diameter of veins, reflecting venous health.
Vein Distance Tortuosity: Degree of venous path curvature.
Vein Squared Curvature Tortuosity: Cumulative squared curvature values of veins.
Vein Tortuosity Density: Density of venous tortuosity.
