# Retina-CSVD

The file "UKB_retinal_CSVD_markers.xlsx" contains retinal imaging analysis markers based on the UKB dataset, along with values for white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) and choroid plexus volume (CPV). It serves as the database used in the study "Retinal Vascular Morphology Reflects and Predicts Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: Evidence from Eye-Brain Imaging Analysis," where retinal imaging features are used to predict WMHV and CPV values.
